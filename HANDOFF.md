## Critical Discoveries Day 28

### Tiny house = best recovery item
- Full HP/MP restore + clears Beaten Up + **no adventure cost**
- Currently have 3. Hoard them for emergencies.

### Phonics down = pre-boss buff
- +98 HP, +99 MP, +Tingly Wrists (+Mys), +Tingly Elbows (+Mys/Mox) for 3 turns each
- Currently have 1 left.

### Bonerdagon wing-flap mechanic (CORRECTED via wiki + observation)
- **Boss has only 120 HP** — one Cannelloni at Mys 97+ does ~98 dmg = nearly one-shots
- Wing-flap disrupts both skills AND items (per wiki: 25%, but my observed rate was ~86%)
- MP not consumed when disrupted, but you still take 37 spooky dmg
- **Safe Moxie = 98** (he can't hit you above this)
- Guaranteed drops: chest of the Bonerdagon, skull of the Bonerdagon
- **Strategy options**:
  - Push **Moxie to 98+** (safe Moxie threshold) — he can't hit you, just keep casting until 1 lands
  - Or bring lots of MP + tiny houses + scroll of drastic healing for sustainability through disrupts
  - Or test combat items (smut orc keepsake box, hellion cube, dried face) — wiki says items also disrupted, but worth testing

### Skill IDs from page DOM
- Manicotti Meditation = 3000
- Lasagna Bandages = 3009
- Springy Fusilli = 3015
- Cannelloni Cannon = 3005
- Entangling Noodles = 3004
- Spaghetti Spear = 3020

### URL patterns (verified working)
- Cast skill quantity: `runskillz.php?action=Skillz&whichskill=ID&ajax=1&quantity=N&pwd=HASH`
- Eat: `inv_eat.php?which=1&whichitem=ID&pwd=HASH`
- Use item: `inv_use.php?which=3&whichitem=ID&pwd=HASH` (some items need which=1)
- Combat skill: `fight.php?action=skill&whichskill=ID`
- Get pwd hash: regex from page HTML `pwd[=:]\s*['"]?([a-f0-9]{32})`

### Consumables economy
- ghuol egg = 1 fullness, 1 adv (low quality, fills space)
- stale baguette = ~3 fullness, 6 advs (-7 meat from hooligans event)
- pink slime = ~4 fullness, similar advs
- glass of goat's milk = 1 booze, 1 adv (only "drink" I had)

## Combat Strategy Status

### Pasta One-Two Punch (Pastamancer combo)
1. **Round 1**: Entangling Noodles (3 MP) → STUNS for Pastamancers
2. **Round 2+**: Cannelloni Cannon (8 MP) — does ~98 dmg at Mys 97-103
3. **Threshold**: HP < 35% → Lasagna Bandages (6 MP, ~12-21 HP heal)
4. **MP < 6**: Spaghetti Spear (1 MP) basic chip damage
5. **Backup**: Marcellus + Ned drain blood every round → heal you for ~25-50 HP, also damage enemy ~20

### Combat tick code (works in DevTools / mainpane JS)

```javascript
window._snarfblat = 81; // airship, change as needed
window.tick = function() {
  var doc = frames['mainpane'].document;
  var t = (doc.body.innerText || '').toLowerCase();
  if (t.includes('adventure again')) {
    if (t.includes('out of adventures') || t.includes('tired')) return 'done';
    frames['mainpane'].location.href = 'adventure.php?snarfblat=' + window._snarfblat;
    return 'next adv';
  }
  if (t.includes('beaten up')) return 'beaten up - stop';
  var sels = doc.querySelectorAll('select');
  var hasSkillBtn = false;
  doc.querySelectorAll('input[type="submit"]').forEach(b => {
    if ((b.value || '').includes('Use Skill')) hasSkillBtn = true;
  });
  if (t.includes("you're fighting") && hasSkillBtn && sels.length >= 2) {
    var skillSel = sels[1];
    var charText = frames['charpane'].document.body.innerText;
    var nums = charText.match(/(\d+)\s*\/\s*(\d+)/g) || [];
    var hpFrac = 1, mp = 999;
    if (nums.length >= 1) {
      var p = nums[0].split('/').map(s => parseInt(s.trim()));
      hpFrac = p[0]/p[1];
    }
    if (nums.length >= 2) {
      var p = nums[1].split('/').map(s => parseInt(s.trim()));
      mp = p[0];
    }
    var target;
    // FIXED: gate Lasagna on MP >= 6
    if (hpFrac < 0.35 && mp >= 6) target = 'Lasagna';
    else if (mp < 8) target = 'Spaghetti';
    else target = 'Cannelloni';
    for (var i = 0; i < skillSel.options.length; i++) {
      if (skillSel.options[i].textContent.includes(target)) {
        skillSel.selectedIndex = i;
        skillSel.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles: true}));
        break;
      }
    }
    var btns = doc.querySelectorAll('input[type="submit"], button');
    for (var b of btns) {
      if ((b.value || '').includes('Use Skill')) { b.click(); break; }
    }
    return 'cast ' + target + ' (HP ' + (hpFrac*100|0) + '% MP ' + mp + ')';
  }
  if (!hasSkillBtn) {
    var btns = doc.querySelectorAll('input[type="submit"], button');
    for (var b of btns) {
      var v = (b.value || b.textContent || '').toLowerCase();
      if (v && !v.includes('away') && v.length > 3) {
        b.click();
        return 'choice: ' + v;
      }
    }
  }
  return 'idle';
};
```

**Known bot bug (Day 28)**: Original tick had `if (hpFrac < 0.4) target = 'Lasagna'` which fires at MP 0/1, fails silently, infinite loop. **Fixed**: gate Lasagna on `hpFrac < 0.35 && mp >= 6`. Above is the corrected version.

## What Worked Well ✅

- **EAT → ADVENTURE → DRINK** order — never reverse. Critical lesson from Day 4.
- **Pasta thrall + familiar combo** — they auto-attack/heal every round. Even with my pasta spoon doing 1 dmg, they can solo low-tier enemies (oil slick: 1 + 16 + 16 = 33 dmg total).
- **Cannelloni Cannon** at Mys 97-103 = 90-110 dmg per cast, 1-2 shots most airship/peak enemies.
- **Tiny house emergency recovery** — confirmed cures Beaten Up and doesn't cost adv.

## What Didn't Work ❌

- **Bonerdagon spell-only strategy** — wing-flap disruption breaks Pastamancer's whole MO. Need combat items or much higher Mys.
- **Penultimate Fantasy Airship at Mys 97** — Burly Sidekick + MagiMechTech MechaMech keep Beaten Up'ing me. Each BU = 1 tiny house spent.
- **Cooking dry noodles + lihc eye** — not a recipe at my crafting tier.
- **Run Away has random success** — got stuck running 3 times in a row, used 3 advs for nothing.
- **`runskillz.php` via fetch** — returned 200 but length 0. Use mainpane navigation (`location.href`) instead, which definitely works.

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Day 30) — UPDATED

1. **Moxie boost for Castle Basement** — Mox 65 is too low (need safe Mox 98). Need to find +Mox accessories. Check `inventory.php?which=2`. Also use phonics down (3 available, +Mox via Tingly Elbows).
2. **Continue Penultimate Fantasy Airship grinding** — best zone for: stat XP, meat, tiny house drops, phonics down drops. Safe at current stats.
3. **Find Twin Peak entry** — still mysterious, may be sub-area or trigger event.

## Tomorrow's Priorities (Day 29) — COMPLETED Day 29

1. **Continue Castle Basement** — ATTEMPTED ❌ (Mox 65 too low, took BU twice)
2. **Twin Peak Pantry** — Lvl 9 Highland zone. Need 50%+ item drops gear. Check inventory which=2 for any +ItemDrop accessories.
3. **Meatcar assembly** — Untinker NPC at `place.php?whichplace=knoll_friendly` was BLOCKED today. Investigate alternative paths (might need different snarfblat or NPC). Have all 13 springs / 9 sprockets / 11 cogs / 10 empty meat tanks / 14 tires.
4. **Nemesis Quest** — start the Pastamancer "Me and My Nemesis" guild quest. See `mechanics/nemesis-quest.md`.
5. **Buff stack for tough fights**:
   - 7 glittery mascara (+5 Mox each), 7 hair spray (+15% Mox), 7 Ben-Gal (+5 Mus)
   - All stack as different effects! Use 1 of each for ~+15 Mox boost
   - Use 1 hardening cream (DR 50, 50 turns) before any boss attempt
   - Use 1 sparkling orb for Latently Energized (HP/MP cap boost)
6. **Cheap booze hunt** — Mall booze starts at 23,799 meat (too expensive). Try:
   - Adventure Bat Hole zones (booze drops?)
   - Hidden Tavern (cheap drinks if accessible)
   - Knob Goblin seltzer (Outskirts of Cobb's Knob)
7. **Pool Skill push** for Haunted Billiards Room — pool shark hair oil + cast + chalk + drunk 10 = enough skill.

## ⚠️ Bonerdagon Lessons Learned (Day 28) — RESOLVED

- Bonerdagon HP = 120, but wing-flap disrupted 6/7 spell attempts
- **WINNING STRATEGY**: hardening cream (Really Hard DR 50) makes his 37-dmg attacks deal 1 dmg
- Just keep casting Cannelloni until one lands — at Mys 100+ each successful cast does 55-98 dmg
- Mox 79 was enough to occasionally fumble his attacks (safe Mox = 98 ideal, but not required with DR 50)
- Day 28 final fight: 4 disrupts, 1 Cannelloni success, 4 his hits totaling 4 HP damage. Easy win once strategy was correct.

## 🔑 KEY DAY 28 DISCOVERIES

### hardening cream (spleen item) → "Really Hard"
- **Damage Reduction: 50** (flat, possibly percentage)
- 50 turns duration
- Toxicity: 1 (1 spleen)
- **GAME CHANGER for any tough fight** — turns 37-dmg attacks into 1 dmg

### sparkling orb (spleen item) → "Latently Energized"  
- +HP cap, +MP cap
- 30 turns duration

### Buff stack mechanics
- glittery mascara → "Glittering Eyelashes" (+5 Mox flat)
- hair spray → "Butt-Rock Hair" (+15% Mox)
- Ben-Gal Balm → "Go Get 'Em, Tiger!" (+5 Mus)
- ALL STACK as different effects. Total +Mox ≈ +14 from 2 items.

### Mall search field
- Search input is named `pudnuggler` (typical KoL silliness), NOT `searchstring`
- Mall has antique beer (1 mil meat, too expensive) and bark rootbeer (24k+ meat)

### Untinker NPC
- `place.php?whichplace=knoll_friendly` BLOCKED Day 28 ("No, no, no.")
- Needs investigation: meatcar quest may require different approach
- Alternative: could be quest-gated, may need to advance Council quests first

## Optimal Daily Routine (Template)

1. **Log in** (`login.php` or `game.php`)
2. **Cast Pastamastery** (once/day, summons dry noodles)
3. **Cast Manicotti Meditation × 5+** (Pasta Oneness stack — minor +Mys but cheap)
4. **Cast Springy Fusilli** (10 MP, +20% initiative for 10 turns)
5. **Use phonics down** if available — pre-buff for tough fights
6. **Eat food** (best food first, ghuol eggs to top off — pasta crafting doesn't work yet)
7. **Adventure** with Cannelloni Cannon spam, retreat at HP < 30%
8. **Use tiny house** if Beaten Up
9. **Drink booze last** to bank advs (rolloover preserves up to 200 advs)
10. **Write daily diary** in `my-adventures/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
